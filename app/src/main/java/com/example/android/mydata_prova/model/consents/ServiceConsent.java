/**
 * This class represent the consent given by the user upon registering the
 * service. It ensures that both parties are reliable by storing a signed token
 * from both of them, along with the timestamp of its creation. The Status of
 * this consent can take one of the following values at a time: Active,
 * Disabled, Withdrawn. If the ConsentStatus is Active, it is possible for the
 * user to ask to be provided with the service registered, while it is not
 * possible to do so if the status is Withdrawn or Disabled. The difference
 * between a Disabled and a Withdrawn ConsentStatus relies in the fact that a
 * Disabled ConsentStatus can be switched back to Active, while it is not
 * possible to re-activate a Withdrawn ServiceConsent. In the latter case, a new
 * ServiceConsent has to be issued.
